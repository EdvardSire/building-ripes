# Building ripes

This is a simple, hardcoded buildscript for [Ripes](https://github.com/mortbopet/Ripes), the simulator used in TDT4160.

One can simply run:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EdvardSire/building-ripes/main/build.sh)"
```

If this doesn't work feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/EdvardSire/building-ripes/issues/new):)
